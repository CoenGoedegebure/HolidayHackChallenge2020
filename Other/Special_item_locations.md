* **Proxmark3**: On the floow in the Wrapping room (North of the Workshop area)

#### Bulbs
Bulbs can be used to change to color of the Santavator's electron beam. Linking a colored electron beam with the power inlet of the same color will send power to that inlet. Different color combinations will enable the Santavator floor buttons:
* The Green power inlet will enable the KringleCon talks button
* The Red power inlet will enable the NetWars button
* The Red + Green power inlet will enable the Workshop button (provided you have the Elevator 1.5 button)
* The Red + Green + Yellow power inlet will enable Santa's office

#### Special purposes
