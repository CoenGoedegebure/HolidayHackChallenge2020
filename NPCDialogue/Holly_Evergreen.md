Holly Evergreen can be found in the kitchen and will provide a hint for objective 8 if you can help them out with their terminal "Redis Bug Hunt".

Holly Evergreen's opening dialogue
* Hi, so glad to see you! I'm Holly Evergreen.
* I've been working with this Redis-based terminal here.
* We're quite sure there's a bug in it, but we haven't caught it yet.
* The maintenance port is available for curling, if you'd like to investigate.
* Can you check the source of the index.php page and look for the bug?
* I read something online recently about remote code execution on Redis. That might help!
* I think I got close to RCE, but I get mixed up between commas and plusses.
* You'll figure it out, I'm sure!

After completing the terminal Holly provides a hint for objective 8:
* See? I knew you could to it!
* I wonder, could we figure out the problem with the Tag Generator if we can get the source code?
* Can you figure out the path to the script?
* I've discovered that enumerating all endpoints is a really good idea to understand an application's functionality.
* Sometimes I find the Content-Type header hinders the browser more than it helps.
* If you find a way to execute code blindly, maybe you can redirect to a file then download that file?

After completing the Tag Generator objective:
* Wow, you really got creative in tackling the Tag Generator! Nicely done!
