Minty Candycane can be found in the Workshop and will provide a hint for objective 6 if you can help them out with their terminal "Sort-O-Matic"

Mintyâ€™s opening dialogue
* Hey there, KringleCon attendee! I'm Minty Candycane!
* I'm working on fixing the Present Sort-O-Matic.
* The Sort-O-Matic uses JavaScript regular expressions to sort presents apart from misfit toys, but it's not working right.
* With some tools, regexes need / at the beginning and the ends, but they aren't used here.
* You can find a regular expression cheat sheet [here](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript) if you need it.
* You can use [this](https://regex101.com/) regex interpreter to test your regex against the required Sort-O-Matic patterns.
* Do you think you can help me fix it?

After completing the terminal, Minty Candycane provides a hint for objective 6:
* Great job! You make this look easy!
* Hey, have you tried the Splunk challenge?
* Are you newer to SOC operations? Maybe check out his [intro talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIhHhRKQCw) from last year.
* Dave Herrald is doing a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVgEFt08kU) on tracking adversary emulation through Splunk!
* Don't forget about useful tools including [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for decoding and decrypting data!
* It's down in the Great Room, but oh, they probably won't let an attendee operate it.
