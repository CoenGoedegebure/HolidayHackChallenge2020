Bushy Evergreen can be found in the Talks Lobby and will provide a hint for objective 5 if you can help them out with their terminal "Speaker UNPrep".

Bushyâ€™s opening dialogue
*	Ohai! Bushy Evergreen, just trying to get this door open.
*	It's running some Rust code written by Alabaster Snowball.
*	I'm pretty sure the password I need for ./door is right in the executable itself.
*	Isn't there a way to view the human-readable strings in a binary file?

#### Completed Door Challenge ####
After completing the Door challenge, Bushy provides a hint for objective 5 and the lights challenge
*	That's it! What a great password...
*	Oh, this might be a good time to mention another lock in the castle.
*	Santa asked me to ask you to evaluate the security of our new HID lock.
*	If ever you find yourself in posession of a Proxmark3, click it in your badge to interact with it.
*	It's a slick device that can read others' badges!
*	Hey, you want to help me figure out the light switch too? Those come in handy sometimes.
*	The password we need is in the lights.conf file, but it seems to be encrypted.
*	There's another instance of the program and configuration in ~/lab/ you can play around with.
*	What if we set the user name to an encrypted value?

#### Completed Lights Challenge ####
After completing the Lights challenge, Bushy provides a hint for objective 5 and the vendor-machines challenge
*	Wow - that worked? I mean, it worked! Hooray for opportunistic decryption, I guess!
*	Oh, did I mention that the Proxmark can simulate badges? Cool, huh?
*	There are lots of references online to help.
*	In fact, there's a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=647U85Phxgo) going on right now!
*	So hey, if you want, there's one more challenge.
*	You see, there's a vending machine in there that the speakers like to use sometimes.
*	Play around with ./vending_machines in the lab folder.
*	You know what might be worth trying? Delete or rename the config file and run it.
*	Then you could set the password yourself to AAAAAAAA or BBBBBBBB.
*	If the encryption is simple code book or rotation ciphers, you'll be able to roll back the original password.

#### Completed Vendor-machines Challenge ####
After completing the vendor-machines objective, Bushy provides a hint for objective 5
*	Your lookup table worked - great job! That's one way to defeat a polyalphabetic cipher!
*	Good luck navigating the rest of the castle.
*	And that Proxmark thing? Some people scan other people's badges and try those codes at locked doors.
*	Other people scan one or two and just try to vary room numbers.
*	Do whatever works best for you!
