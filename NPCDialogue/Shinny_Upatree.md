Shinny Upatree can be found in the castle approach and will provide a hint for objective 2 if you can help them out with their terminal "Kringle Kiosk".

Shinny's opening dialogue
*	Hiya hiya - I'm Shinny Upatree!
*   Check out this cool KringleCon kiosk!
*   You can get a map of the castle, learn about where the elves are, and get your own badge printed right on-screen!
*	Be careful with that last one though. I heard someone say it's "ingestible." Or something...
*	Do you think you could check and see if there is an issue?

After completing the Kringle Kiosk terminal, Shinny provides a hint for objective 2:
*	Golly - wow! You sure found the flaw for us!
*	Say, we've been having an issue with an Amazon S3 bucket.
*	Do you think you could help find Santa's package file?
*	Jeepers, it seems there's always a leaky bucket in the news. You'd think we could find our own files!
*	Digininja has a great guide, if you're new to S3 searching.
*	He even released a tool for the task - what a guy!
*	The package wrapper Santa used is reversible, but it may take you some trying.
*	Good luck, and thanks for pitching in!!
