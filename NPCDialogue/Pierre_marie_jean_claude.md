Pierre, Marie and Jean-claude can be found in the Castle Approach. If you talk to them with your own character, they speak French. Speak to them as Santa and they'll speak in English. I guess that's to emphasize that Santa speaks every language!

Pierre:
* As yourself: Bonjour!
* As Santa: Hello!


Marie:
* As yourself: Joyeuses fÃªtes!
* As Santa: Happy Holidays!

Jean-Claude:
* As yourself: Jacques DuGivre!
* As Santa: Jack Frost!
