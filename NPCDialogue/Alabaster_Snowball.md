Alabaster Snowball can be found in the NetWars room and will provide a hint for objective 9 if you can help them out with their terminal "Scapy Prepper".

Alabaster Snowball's opening dialogue
* Welcome to the roof! Alabaster Snowball here.
* I'm watching some elves play NetWars!
* Feel free to try out our Scapy Present Packet Prepper!
* If you get stuck, you can help() to see how to get tasks and hints.

After completing the terminal, Alabaster provides a hint for objective 9:
* Great job! Thanks!
* Those skills might be useful to you later on!
* I've been trying those skills out myself on this other terminal.
* I'm pretty sure I can use tcpdump to sniff some packets.
* Then I'm going to try a machine-in-the-middle attack.
* Next, I'll spoof a DNS response to point the host to my terminal.
* Then I want to respond to its HTTP request with something I'll cook up.
* I'm almost there, but I can't quite get it. I could use some help!
* For privacy reasons though, I can't let you access this other terminal.
* I do plan to ask Santa for a hand with it next time he's nearby, though.
