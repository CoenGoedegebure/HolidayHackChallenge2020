After completing the terminal, Sugarplum Maryâ€™s provides a hint for objective 3:
*	You did it - great! Maybe you can help me configure my postfix mail server on Gentoo!
*	Just kidding!
*	Hey, wouldja' mind helping me get into my point-of-sale terminal?
*	It's down, and we kinda' need it running.
*	Problem is: it is asking for a password. I never set one!
*	Can you help me figure out what it is so I can get set up?
*	Shinny says this might be an Electron application.
*	I hear there's a way to extract an ASAR file from the binary, but I haven't looked into it yet.
