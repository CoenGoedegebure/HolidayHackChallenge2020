Ribb Bonbowford can be found in the dining room and will provide a hint for objective 10 if you can help them out with their terminal "Elfcode".

Ribb Bonbowford's opening dialogue
* Hello - my name is Ribb Bonbowford. Nice to meet you!
* Are you new to programming? It's a handy skill for anyone in cyber security.
* This challenge centers around JavaScript. Take a look at this intro and see how far it gets you!
* Ready to move beyond elf commands? Don't be afraid to mix in native JavaScript.
* Trying to extract only numbers from an array? Have you tried to filter?
* Maybe you need to enumerate an object's keys and then filter?
* Getting hung up on number of lines? Maybe try to minify your code.
* Is there a way to push array items to the beginning of an array? Hmm...

After completing the terminal, Ribb will provide a hint for objective 10:
* Wow - are you a JavaScript developer? Great work!
* Hey, you know, you might use your JavaScript and HTTP manipulation skills to take a crack at bypassing the Santavator's S4.
