Tangle Coalbox can be found in the Speaker UNPreparedness room and will provide a hint for objective 11a/b if you can help them out with their terminal "Snowball".

Tangle Coalbox's opening dialogue
* Howdy gumshoe. I'm Tangle Coalbox, resident sleuth in the North Pole.
* If you're up for a challenge, I'd ask you to look at this here Snowball Game.
* We tested an earlier version this summer, but that one had web socket vulnerabilities.
* This version seems simple enough on the Easy level, but the Impossible level is, well...
* I'd call it impossible, but I just saw someone beat it! I'm sure something's off here.
* Could it be that the name a player provides has some connection to how the forts are laid out?
* Knowing that, I can see how an elf might feed their Hard name into an Easy game to cheat a bit.
* But on Impossible, the best you get are rejected player names in the page comments. Can you use those somehow?
* Check out Tom Liston's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo5Nlbqd-Vg) for more info, if you need it.

After completing the terminal, Tangle will provide a hint for objective 11a/b:
* Crikey - that's it! You've done the Impossible! You've impressed this old elf today.
* Great work identifying and abusing the pseudo-random sequence.
* Now, the REAL question is, how else can this be abused? Do you think someone could try and cheat the Naughty/Nice Blockchain with this?
* If you have control over to bytes in a file, it's easy to create MD5 [hash collisions](https://github.com/corkami/collisions).
* Problem is: there's that nonce that he would have to know ahead of time.
* A blockchain works by "chaining" blocks together - so there's no way that Jack could change it without it messing up the chain...
* Maybe if you look at the block that seems like it got changed, it might help.
* If Jack was able to change the block AND the document without changing the hash... that would require a very [UNIque hash COLLision](https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/hashclash).
* Apparently Jack was able to change just 4 bytes in the block to completely change everything about it. It's like some sort of [evil game](https://speakerdeck.com/ange/colltris) to him.
* That's about all the help I can give you, kid, but Prof. Petabyte may have [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rLMl88p-ec).

After completing objective 11a and b:
* I ... I'm really impressed.
* Wow, you really did it!
