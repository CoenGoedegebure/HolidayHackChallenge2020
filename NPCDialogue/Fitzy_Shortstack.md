Fitzy Shortstack can be found in the kitchen next to the terminal "Dialup".

Fitzy Shortstack's opening dialogue
* "Put it in the cloud," they said...
* "It'll be great," they said...
* All the lights on the Christmas trees throughout the castle are controlled through a remote server.
* We can shuffle the colors of the lights by connecting via dial-up, but our only modem is broken!
* Fortunately, I speak dial-up. However, I can't quite remember the [handshake sequence](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Dial_up_modem_noises.ogg).
* Maybe you can help me out? The phone number is **756-8347**; you can use this blue phone.

After completing the challenge, Fitzy has this dialogue:
* 탢ݵרOُ񆨶$Ԩ؉楌Բ ahem! We did it! Thank you!!
* Anytime you feel like changing the color scheme up, just pick up the phone!
* You know, Santa really seems to trust Shinny Upatree...
