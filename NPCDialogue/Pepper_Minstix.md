Pepper Minstix can be found in the castle approach and will provide a hint for objective 4 if you can help them out with their terminal "Unescape Tmux".

Pepper Minstix' opening dialogue
*	Howdy - Pepper Minstix here!
*	I've been playing with tmux lately, and golly it's useful.
*	Problem is: I somehow became detached from my session.
*	Do you think you could get me back to where I was, admiring a beautiful bird?
*	If you find it handy, there's a tmux cheat sheet you can use as a reference.
*	I hope you can help!

After completing the terminal Pepper Minstix provides a hint for objective 4:
*	You found her! Thanks so much for getting her back!
*	Hey, maybe I can help YOU out!
*	There's a Santavator that moves visitors from floor to floor, but it's a bit wonky.
*	You'll need a key and other odd objects. Try talking to Sparkle Redberry about the key.
*	For the odd objects, maybe just wander around the castle and see what you find on the floor.
*	Once you have a few, try using them to split, redirect, and color the Super Santavator Sparkle Stream (S4).
*	You need to power the red, yellow, and green receivers with the right color light!
