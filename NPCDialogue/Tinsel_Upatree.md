Tinsel Upatree can be found in Santa's Office and gives a hint for objectives 11a and 11b.

When you speak to him as Santa:
* Howdy Santa! Just guarding the Naughty/Nice list on your desk.
* Santa, I don't know if you've heard, but something is very, very wrong...
* We tabulated the latest score of the Naughty/Nice Blockchain.
* Jack Frost is the nicest being in the world! Jack Frost!?!
* As you know, we only really start checking the Naughty/Nice totals as we get closer to the holidays.
* Out of nowhere, Jack Frost has this crazy score... positive 4,294,935,958 nice points!
* No one has EVER gotten a score that high! No one knows how it happened.
* Most of us recall Jack having a NEGATIVE score only a few days ago...
* Worse still, his huge positive score seems to have happened way back in March.
* Our first thought was that he somehow changed the blockchain - but, as you know, that isn't possible.
* We ran a validation of the blockchain and it all checks out.
* Even the smallest change to any block should make it invalid.
* Blockchains are huge, so we cut a one minute chunk from when Jack's big score registered back in March.
* You can get a slice of the Naughty/Nice blockchain on your desk.
* You can get some [tools to help you here](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/OfficialNaughtyNiceBlockchainEducationPack.zip).
* Tangle Coalbox, in the Speaker UNPreparedness room. has been talking with attendees about the issue.

When you enter Santa's Office as yourself after defeating the Fingerprint Sensor (objective 10)
* GOSHGOLLY
* How did you get in here??
* I mean, hey, I'm impressed you made it in here, but you've got to leave!
* Breaking into Santa's office might mean immediate membership on the wrong side of the Naughty/Nice List.

After defeating objective 11b (Speaking to Tinsel as Santa):
* The mystery is solved! I can't wait to see which attendee solved it!

After defeating objective 11b (Speaking to Tinsel as yourself):
* You - you did it! You solved the mystery!
* Quickly, go out to the balcony to be recognized!
